## Current System Analysis

### **System Purpose**
Your ChatGPT Rank Tracker monitors brand mentions and sentiment in AI-generated responses, helping businesses understand their visibility in AI search results. The system processes prompts through ChatGPT via BrightData, analyzes responses using OpenAI, and provides analytics through a dashboard.

### **Current Scoring Limitations**

#### **LCP (Linked Citation Potential) Issues:**
1. **Oversimplified Domain Scoring**: All domains get equal weight (8 points each)
2. **No Authority Assessment**: `.edu` domains treated same as low-quality sites
3. **Binary Freshness**: 90-day cutoff is arbitrary and inflexible
4. **Limited Content Analysis**: Only basic content type detection
5. **No Competitive Context**: Scores exist in isolation

#### **Actionability Issues:**
1. **Static Point Values**: Fixed bonuses don't reflect real-world impact
2. **Missing User Signals**: No engagement or conversion metrics
3. **Content Quality Ignored**: Only structural elements considered
4. **No Intent Matching**: Doesn't align with user search intent
5. **Outdated Staleness Logic**: 365-day threshold is too broad

#### **Missing Difficulty Metric:**
- Currently no difficulty calculation exists
- No framework for combining LCP and Actionability into difficulty
- No competitive analysis or market context

## Proposed Improved Algorithm

### **1. Enhanced LCP (Linked Citation Potential) - 0-100 Scale**

#### **A. Domain Authority Weighting (60% of score)**
```
Base Formula: Σ(Domain_Authority_Score × Content_Relevance_Factor)

Domain Authority Tiers:
- Tier 1 (.edu, .gov, major news): 15 points each (max 4 domains = 60 points)
- Tier 2 (established brands, DR 70+): 10 points each (max 6 domains = 60 points)  
- Tier 3 (medium authority, DR 30-69): 6 points each (max 10 domains = 60 points)
- Tier 4 (low authority, DR <30): 3 points each (max 20 domains = 60 points)

Content Relevance Factor: 0.5-1.5 multiplier based on topical alignment
```

#### **B. Content Quality Assessment (25% of score)**
```
Quality Indicators:
- Content Depth: +5 points (>1000 words equivalent)

- Content Quality Gap: 0-20 points  
- Brand Recognition Factor: 0-15 points
- Market Saturation: 0-15 points
- Seasonal/Trending Factors: ±10 points

Calculation:
Competition_Score = (Avg_DA/2) + Content_Gap + Brand_Factor + Saturation - Trending_Bonus
```

#### **B. Content Requirements (30% of score)**
```
Resource Assessment:
- Content Length Required: 0-15 points (based on top performers)
- Research Depth Needed: 0-10 points (original data, expert interviews)
